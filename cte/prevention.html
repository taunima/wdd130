                <h3>CTE Prevention</h3>
                <p>As we learned from, "What is CTE?" page it is a very unknown disease that experts are still trying to understand. So much so that there is no real cure, and this is in part to the fact that we don't know much about it. But that doesn't mean we can't try to prevent it from happening. So that is what this page will address so that we can prevent it from happening in the future.</p>
                <p>Preventing CTE from happening is more a long-term game and this is because of the way that CTE works. CTE develops over time and so the best way to ensure to stop this disease from happening or developing is by simply limiting the amount of contact with the head and mostly concussions. When you do this your brain will not experience those symptoms that are associated with concussions or brain injuries. But of course, this is easier said than done for those athletes that deal with daily. So, for those athletes' measures have been taken to improve equipment and have more technical training so that you can have safer contact. This is will hopefully prevent you from developing CTE and if concussions get worse it is more than likely you will be advised to step away. CTE prevention will take time so be patient and practice safely.</p>
                <p>Practicing for both those who play in those high-risk sports and even just for those of us who are normal people. Experts don't know the exact estimation for the general population but what they do know is that we all must practice safety to prevent it from happening. So, please be careful out there and always practice safety!</p>
