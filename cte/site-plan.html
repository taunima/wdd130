    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Athletes around the world know the dangers of their sport and this site will help those who are in contact sports who are in danger of developing CTE. This danger is growing everywhere but it is especially growing in those sports that are high in contact and collision. So, this site is to inform and address the concerns of CTE to the public so that all may be made aware and know how it can affect those around them and how to prevent it from happening to yourself.</p>
    
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Those of you who play contact sports know that it takes countless practices to teach proper technique and develop skill so that you can avoid injury to the head. But like any sport, injury is not unavoidable but can be preventable. This site is to inform the dangers of developing CTE and what you can do so that you can prevent it from happening to you.</p>

    <h4>What is CTE?</h4>
    <p>CTE is an acronym that stands for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, and this is a progressive degenerative disease affecting those who have repeated concussions or traumatic brain injuries. When this happens it is a progressive disease that will run its course and there is no way to stop this. This can happen to anyone who has a traumatic brain injury or just head injuries in general. But this is mostly shown in athletes who are in contact and collision sports, but it is mostly seen so far in American football, but it is shown in other sports as well that deal with a lot of contact with the head. But we must be vigilant now so that we can find a way to curb this disease or at the very least find more ways to treat this so that those in the future may be able to find a way to cure it because as of right now there is not cure for it that we know of.</p>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>

        <td class="accent2"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Typography</h3>

    <h3>How common is CTE?</h3>
    <p>
      This injury is not as common as people may seem to believe but it is a growing concern among young athletes in contact and collision sports. We don't have a number yet as to the number of people who have CTE, but we do know that it is rare. It is estimated that less than 1% of the general population have developed CTE and among athletes in contact and collision sports are more prone to this and that is the concern we must address because this does not affect those athletes at the top level but also young athletes who are just starting. Though the number is unclear for athletes of all ages who have CTE it is still a concern nonetheless because it is a disease that is not treatable now. So, we must take precautions to help the athletes prevent this or at the very least give them equipment that will help them lessen contact with the brain.
    </p>
    <h3>How can we prevent CTE?</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      Since we do not have a lot of information about CTE, the only way to prevent it is to essentially prevent head injuries in general. This is the only protective measure we have so far but with this being brought to the public eye there is hope that we will have more information in the future. Some sports have thought to increase padding in helmets and what not so the blows to the head are less impactful. But of course, that is not getting the job done with preventing CTE because it is a progressive disease that will get worse over time until you pass. So, we must be patient for now and do our best to avoid brain injuries and be the safest we can within each athletes' sports so that we can treat it in the future.
