                <h2>What is Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy?</h2>
                <p>Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or more commonly known as CTE, is a disease that occurs in the brain when you have multiple concussions or injuries to the brain. When this happens CTE then grows over time and as of now the ways to diagnosis this is with high exposures with people or with an autopsy. With that in mind experts have yet to figure out why this happens with the brain. So, more research is still happening but the sad news of this is that we cannot do more research unto they have already passed on. But research will continue to happen so that we can start to figure this out.</p>
                <p>With all this research though we still have many questions to answer and as of this moment we do not have the answers just yet. For instance, researchers are stil trying to figure out how many injuries to the brain happes before CTE occurs and what other factors also contribute to this as well. Or why it can take up to decades for CTE to fully develop but like all things we need time to figure it out. But until it does as of right now there is no known cure for this and so research continues. So, we must be careful with concussions and brain injuries until then.</p>
